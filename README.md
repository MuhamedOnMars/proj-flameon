# Project 7: Final Project
By: Skyler Hall, Chris Mok, Briana Fedkiw, and Muhamed Ka

Our project focuses on visually appealing features displayed via a scene focusing on a campfire surrounded by a variety of props and a sky dome. To create stylistic effects, we added bloom, fog, color grading, and a stylized Kuwahara filter. Our code-base was built upon the project 5 realtime framework so several of the features are connected to sliders/checkboxes. These include the fog maximum and minimum distances, the exposure from HDR rendering, the bloom/filter, and the color grading. The skydome and the camera paths are baked into the code, so they automatically get applied when a scene is opened. The objects in the scene were all handmade via Blender except for the chest/pots from artist Max Hay and campfire (excluding the actual fire) from Adobe Stock. The different variants of trees were created via L-systems.
